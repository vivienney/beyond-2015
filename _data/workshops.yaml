  title: "JavaScript Graphics and Animation"
  description: >
    <p>In this short workshop we'll take a look at HTML5 canvas and learn how to create sophisticated graphics and animation in JavaScript. You'll learn how to draw, animate, and create engaging interactive content, with mouse interactions, image blending, and physics.</p>
    <p>“Seb’s workshop was a delight… it is a must-attend: you’ll need these skills as a developer, but also you learn that it’s not nearly as hard as it looks.” – Paul Irish</p>
    <p>You'll require a laptop with a browser and a text editor. I use Chrome and TextMate, but anything will do. A basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript will be helpful. </p>
