Got your ticket and blocked out the 23rd November in your calendar? Here’s just a snippet of what you’ll get out of your day at Beyond. 

**Make more with less.**

When we asked what delegates were most looking forward to at Beyond, one of the top answers was, unsurprisingly, advancing their technical know-how. Talks from the likes of Google’s Paul Lewis and Swiftkey’s Maxim Cramer will be addressing just that. They'll take delegates through how to optimise their work flow by looking at web performance as a whole, as well as how to find crucial insights into their products through regular user testing. Off-stage, coding bootcamp Makers Academy will run a workshop on how to power forward with test-driven development. Being let into the development processes behind some of the biggest tech products will help you to reach further than your existing tool kit for leaner, more effective working methods.

> “As a ‘newbie’ I’m always keen to hear the ‘right way’ to do things. There are often a million ways to achieve something in code and a lot of the time you’re on your own.”

><p>- Stephen Giles, Makers Academy Graduate</p>

**Connect around a love of code.**

The second top response to what delegates wanted to get out of the event was to meet people in a similar situation to them. Being a successful developer pivots on a penchant for collaboration and learning from others. When you can’t see the wood for the trees, conversations with other developers can help provide the light-bulb moment a stagnant dev team needs. With attendees from companies like GoCardless and Lyst, you’re set to mingle with the crème de la crème of the development world. Join us at the WeWork after party to keep widening your network and create an invaluable resource to tap into down the line.

> “I am looking forward to meeting fellow junior developers, hearing what they are up to and what exciting projects they are working on.”

><p>- Amra Kujundzic, Junior Software Developer</p>

**Navigate the career ladder**

A career in development is just like any other - with paths and ladders that need to be navigated and climbed. Career talks from Alice Bartlett of the Financial Times will help delegates understand how to get more out of a career in development, while Ruby Developer Linda Liukas’ talk will focus on how to rediscover and retain a junior level of curiosity and enthusiasm, at any stage of your working life. And, whether you're pre first job or somewhere further down the line, pop in to the CV clinic led by Stack Overflow to get invaluable advice on your CV.

> “I'm excited to just be attending Beyond, but I’m definitely looking forward to hearing from the experienced speakers. I’m also very excited for the Github workshop. I feel like the conference was made for someone like me, and it’s a great opportunity that I couldnt miss.”
