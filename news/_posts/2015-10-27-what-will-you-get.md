Every conference is the same. You’re staring at a list of big names in the industry that you either know or know you should know. You're reading the talk titles one by one. Each one sounds great, and you’re sure that it’ll be helpful somehow. But what will you really learn? How can you quantify what you’ll gain from the experience, enough to justify the cost to your employer, or worse, to yourself?

At Steer, the code school behind Beyond, we teach people to build websites in 5 days or less. The mention of 5 days is enough to make any sceptic roll their eyes. But it works. With clients from Apple to Disney, and from M&S to the Financial Times, we know it works. The reason? We focus on real-world projects and situations, circumventing abstract theory that’ll never be needed beyond the classroom. This tried and tested formula has been behind the entire scheduling for Beyond. Every talk, every workshop, every minute of the day has been geared towards offering a true reflection of the world of development, helping delegates leave with practical knowledge they can use from the very next day.

**From Coders to Developers.**

Beginners is a tricky term. Some shed it a few websites in, while others are still clinging on to the title 2 years on. Stepping out of your beginner skin and becoming a full-fledged developer isn’t just about learning more code, it’s about knowing the gaps between the code too. Many of the talks at Beyond will aim to fill those gaps, such as Alex Sexton’s introduction to getting more hands-on with open source. With a workshop led by GitHub too, you’ll be contributing to and learning from open source projects in no time.


> “As a ‘newbie’ I’m always keen to hear the ‘right way’ to do things. There are often a million ways to achieve something in code and a lot of the time you’re on your own.”

> <p>- Stephen Giles, Makers Academy Graduate</p>

**Making more with less.**


When we asked what delegates were most looking forward to at Beyond, one of the top answers was, unsurprisingly, advancing their technical know-how. Talks from the likes of Google’s Paul Lewis and Swiftkey’s Maxim Cramer will be addressing just that. They'll take delegates through how to optimise their work flow by looking at web performance as a whole, as well as how to find crucial insights into their products through regular user testing. Off-stage, coding bootcamp Makers Academy will run a workshop on how to power forward with test-driven development. Being let into the development processes behind some of the biggest tech products will help you to reach further than your existing tool kit for leaner, more effective working methods.

> “As my first event/conference as a professional developer, I’m excited to see the leading names in the industry talk about some of the challenges I’m facing on a daily basis.”

> <p>- Matt Grannell, Front End Developer </p>

**Connecting around a love of code.**

The second top response to what delegates wanted to get out of the event was to meet people in a similar situation to them. Being a successful developer pivots on a penchant for collaboration and learning from others. When you can’t see the wood for the trees, conversations with other developers can help provide the light-bulb moment a stagnant dev team needs. With attendees from companies like GoCardless and Lyst, you’re set to mingle with the crème de la crème of the development world. Join us at the WeWork after party to keep widening your network and create an invaluable resource to tap into down the line.

> “I am looking forward to meeting fellow junior developers, hearing what they are up to and what exciting projects they are working on.”

> <p>- Amra Kujundzic, Junior Software Developer<p>

**Development not just for Developers**

When we surveyed the people who’d bought super early bird tickets, only 45% of them declared themselves as developers. Designer-developers, entrepreneur-developers, hobby-developers and straight-up developers - all sorts of new roles and careers are fusing together and forming around code. Keeping up with the new tools that are being created for these new roles is key to getting ahead in the industry. One such tool is Sketch - the favoured interface design tool of a third of over 4000 participants from 200 countries, according to a survey run by subtraction.com. At Beyond, Sketch will provide a quick dive into using this industry-leading software to design beautiful tech products.

**Navigating the career ladder**

A career in development is just like any other - with paths and ladders that need to be navigated and climbed. Career talks from Alice Bartlett of the Financial Times will help delegates understand how to get more out of a career in development, while Ruby Developer Linda Liukas’ talk will focus on how to rediscover and retain a junior level of curiosity and enthusiasm, at any stage of your working life. And, whether you're pre first job or somewhere further down the line, pop in to the CV clinic led by Stack Overflow to get invaluable advice on your CV.

> “I’m excited to just be attending Beyond, but I’m also very excited for the GitHub workshop. I feel like the conference was made for someone like me, and it’s a great opportunity that I wouldn’t miss.”

> <p>- Freddie Lumor, Developer</p>
