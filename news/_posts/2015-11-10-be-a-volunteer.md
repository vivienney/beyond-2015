As part of our drive towards making Beyond the best conference we possibly can, we’re looking for 15 fun and hard-working volunteers to help out on the day. We want to ensure that every one of our attendees feels as welcome as possible and gets as much as they can out of Beyond. You’ll get a chance to join the core team behind the conference, meet the amazing attendees and be actively involved in the running of the day’s events.

​
As a Beyond volunteer there are a variety of jobs you may be asked to do. From helping register attendees to being on hand at workshops, we’ll need you in different spots around the venue throughout the day—offering directions, answering questions and being generally enthusiastic, attentive and helpful. We’ll make sure to clue you up on everything "Beyond" beforehand so that you’re ready to get involved with every aspect of the day!
​
Not only will you be able to be a part of the Beyond Conf team and meet all of the attendees, you’ll also be invited to the after party at WeWork to celebrate all of your hard work!

If you’re interested in becoming a volunteer, please send a link to your updated LinkedIn Profile (or attach a CV) and Twitter page to [katie@beyondconf.co](mailto:katie@beyondconf.co).
