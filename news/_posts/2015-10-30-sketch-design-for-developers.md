When it comes to designing for the web, being able to understand the
advantages and limitations of the web as a medium is key. But even for
those who know the web inside out, designing a product that is both easy
to use and looks beautiful would be pretty impossible without a great
piece of software.

I’m sure I’m not the only person who feels that design software can be
pretty intimidating. In the past year I’ve been learning to code and also
trying to get to grips with different types of design software. My
conclusion? Sketch is the one for me.

And I’m not the only one. In a recent survery by Subtraction.com, Sketch
came out on top as the most popular tool for digital design, beating the
likes of PhotoShop and InDesign.

template has you designing responsive sites from the word go, with
separate artboards for desktop, tablet and mobile screens. You can easily
create shared styles which enable you to produce the consistency that is
key to great web design.

One of my favourite features is the CSS attributes option. Sketch allows
you to take elements of your static design and translate them into CSS
ready for you to use. It’s software which embraces the whole process of
creating a website and it’s features like this which truly demonstrate that.
Sketch allows you to test any mobile designs on your mobile device with
the Mirror feature. The creators of Sketch appreciate that it’s not enough
just to view mobile designs on your desktop - you need to at least have
an idea of how your design will feel on the device it was created for.

At Beyond, Sketch will be running a workshop, ‘Design for Developers: An Intro to Sketch’, at  11:00 - so, come along and see for yourself what Sketch has to
offer!
